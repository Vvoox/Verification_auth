# Verification_auth
This work was some of my old projects and i would like to share it .
This code is just explanation for facilitate your administrator's task in sign up conditions , instead of finding an aleatory data ,  i put some necessary conditions for email and password for exemple, to be sure that was a human not a robot or something like that .
I write this code to explain how it works , coded by javascript , so your code we'll be public , if you dont want to allow that you should  recoded this methode in PHP for exemple (as you like).
